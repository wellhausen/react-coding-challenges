# React Coding Challenges

A series of easy through to hard, **React.js coding challenges**.

# When could these be useful?
- Usage as short coding exercises, such as for interviews
- To test yourself/test your coding abilities under pressure
- For beginners looking for a fun way to learn React 

# How Do They Work?
The scaffolding is done for you. Simply run `yarn` in any of the directories to start the application. Each application has a README with its requirements.

# Have you got the solutions?
I have completed all the coding challenges to a high standard. If you're interested in being invited to the solutions GitHub repository, get in touch.

# What's coming next?
I'll be adding new coding challenges as I come up with ideas! If you have any ideas you think could be suitable, get in touch via www.alexgurr.com.
